# Introduction

> PifPaf: Composite Fields for Human Pose Estimation
>
> We propose a new bottom-up method for multi-person 2D human pose
> estimation that is particularly well suited for urban mobility such as self-driving cars
> and delivery robots. The new method, PifPaf, uses a Part Intensity Field (PIF) to
> localize body parts and a Part Association Field (PAF) to associate body parts with each other to form
> full human poses.
> Our method outperforms previous methods at low resolution and in crowded,
> cluttered and occluded scenes
> thanks to (i) our new composite field PAF encoding fine-grained information and (ii) the choice of Laplace loss for regressions which incorporates a notion of uncertainty.
> Our architecture is based on a fully
> convolutional, single-shot, box-free design.
> We perform on par with the existing
> state-of-the-art bottom-up method on the standard COCO keypoint task
> and produce state-of-the-art results on a modified COCO keypoint task for
> the transportation domain.

## Install

Python 3 is required. Python 2 is not supported.
Do not clone this repository
and make sure there is no folder named `openpifpaf` in your current directory.

```sh
pip3 install openpifpaf
```

You need to install `matplotlib` to produce visual outputs.

To modify openpifpaf itself, please follow {ref}`modify-code`.

For a live demo, we recommend to try the
[openpifpafwebdemo](https://github.com/vita-epfl/openpifpafwebdemo) project.
Alternatively, `openpifpaf.video` (requires OpenCV) provides a live demo as well.


## About this Guide

This is an auto-generated book.
Many sections of this book, like {doc}`predict_cli`, are interactive:
they are based on Jupyter Notebooks
that can be launched interactively in the cloud by clicking on the rocket
at the top and selecting a cloud provider like _Binder_.
This is also the reason why some pages contain quite a bit of code: this is
all the code required for regenerating that particular page.

__Syntax__: Some code blocks start with an exclamation point "`!`". It means
that this command is executed on the command line. You can run the same command
yourself without the exclamation point.


## Pre-trained Models

Command to reproduce this table: `python -m openpifpaf.benchmark --checkpoints resnet50 shufflenetv2k16 shufflenetv2k30`.

Pretrained model files are shared in the
__[openpifpaf-torchhub](https://github.com/vita-epfl/openpifpaf-torchhub/releases)__
repository and linked from the checkpoint names in the table above.
The pretrained models are downloaded automatically when
using the command line option `--checkpoint checkpointasintableabove`.
