    "Training a model can take several days even with a good GPU. Many times existing models can be refined to avoid training from scratch.\n",

    "## Training Crop Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and evaluation image sizes are _unrelated_ in fully convolutional architectures like OpenPifPaf. _Instance size distribution_ between training and evaluation needs to be preserved. The size of the image that surrounds the instance to detect has little impact: for humans of height 100px, it does not matter whether that is inside a $640\\times480$ image or inside a 4k or 8k image. Therefore, you can keep the size of your training crops (selected with `--square-edge`) quite small even when evaluating on large images. The default is `--square-edge=385` for `cocokp` and that is reasonable when most of the humans are not larger than 300px during evaluation.\n",

    "## Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Every training log file contains the command that was used to train under the key `args`. There is also a `version` key that specifies the precise version of OpenPifPaf that was used to train, like \"0.11.9+204.g987345\" (generated by [versioneer](https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer)). This means that the last tag was 0.11.9, that there are 204 additional commits beyond that tag, and that the hash of the current commit is \"987345\" (without the \"g\" as that simply stands for `git`). If you had uncommitted changes, there is an additional \"dirty\" suffix. Try to avoid \"dirty\" version numbers for training as it is impossible to tell whether you were just correcting a typo in the readme or had a substantial change that influences the training. Your local git command line client but also GitHub can compare to the short git hashes."

    "## Multiple Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenPifPaf supports simultaneous training on multiple datasets. You specify multiple datasets by concatenating them with a `-`, e.g. to train on COCO Keypoints `cocokp` and on COCO Detections `cocodet` you specify in your training command `--dataset=cocokp-cocodet`. This also works for custom datasets defined in plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The samples from each dataset are tracked with weighted counters and the dataset for the next batch is chosen by the lowest counter. You specify the dataset weights (or you can think of it as an importance), for example, as `--dataset-weights 1.0 0.5`. That means that the first dataset (`cocokp` in the above example) is twice as important as the second one (e.g. `cocodet`) and two-thirds of the batches will be from the first dataset and one-third will be from the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "An epoch is over once the first of the datasets is out of samples. As the datasets are randomized during training, a different set of samples will be used from epoch to epoch. That means that eventually all data will be utilized of the larger datasets even if not all data is used during a single epoch."

    "## Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective way to validate the pipeline is working, loss functions are implemented correctly, encoders are correct, etc. is to overfit on a single image. You should be able to produce perfect predictions for that image. Some caveats: you need to deactivate augmentations, you must evaluate at the exact trained image size and the image should not contain crowd annotations (i.e. areas that will be ignored during training). Here is an example training command for a `cocokp` overfitting experiment:\n",

    "The very first image in the training set has a large crowd annotation. Therefore, the above command overfits on four images.\n",
    "Here is the corresponding predict command for the [second image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/infiniteworld/5341741494/) in the training set:\n",

    "While the field predictions are almost perfect, it will predict two annotations while there is only one ground truth annotation. That is because the standard skeleton has no connection that goes directly from left-ear to nose and the left-eye is not visible and not annotated. You can add `--dense-connections` to include additional connections in the skeleton which will connect the nose keypoint to the rest of the skeleton."
