    "OpenPifPaf uses the standard convention of PyTorch models to pad convolutions. \n",
    "Let's start with an example: a single layer of a 3x3 conv with stride 2 that is padded with 1. For an output feature map of size 2x2, the input must be of size 3x3. This generalization holds: the input must be of size `(nx * stride + 1, ny * stride + 1)`.\n",
    "The models that OpenPifPaf uses have an intermediate layer with stride 16. Therefore, good input image sizes are multiples of 16 plus 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually not a problem if the input size is not perfect. There will just be a small margin on the right side and bottom of the image that is not \"covered\" by a feature map cell.\n",

    "I avoid any plotting on my training servers. However, if you insist on creating plots on the server, you might run into constraints of certain matplotlib backends not being available. If you have a backend that you know is working for your setup, you can select it by prepending any command, for example: `MPLBACKEND=agg python3 -m openpifpaf.train ...`. This would set the backend to `agg` but you can use something else. This works for all Python scripts that use matplotlib.\n",
