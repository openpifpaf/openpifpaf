    "## Overview\n",
    "In this section of the guide, we will see how to train and evaluate OpenPifPaf on a custom dataset. OpenPifPaf is based on the concept of __[Plugin architecture pattern](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~m2nagapp/courses/CS446/1195/Arch_Design_Activity/PlugIn.pdf)__, and the overall system is composed of a core component and auxiliary plug-in modules. To train a model on a custom dataset, you don't need to change the core system, only to create a small plugin for it.\n",
    "This tutorial will go through the steps required to create a new plugin for a custom dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's go through the steps of implementing a 2D pose estimator for vehicles, as a case study. If you are interested in how this specific plugin works, please check its {doc}`guide section <plugins_apollocar3d>`. We suggest to create and debug your own plugin copying a pre-existing plugin, changing its name, and adapting its files to your needs.\n",

    "This module handles the interface of your custom dataset with the core system and it is the main component of the plugin. For the [ApolloCar3D Dataset](http://apolloscape.auto/car_instance.html), we created a module called _apollo_kp.py_ containing the class [ApolloKp](https://github.com/openpifpaf/openpifpaf/blob/main/openpifpaf/plugins/apollocar3d/apollo_kp.py) which inherits from the [DataModule](https://github.com/openpifpaf/openpifpaf/blob/main/openpifpaf/datasets/module.py) class.\n",

    "- __Skeleton__: the connections between the keypooints, as a list of lists of two elements indicating the indeces of the starting and ending connections. In our plugin this is called CAR_SKELETON\n",
    "- __Sigmas__: the size of the area to compute the object keypoint similarity (OKS), if you wish to use average precision (AP) as a metric.\n",
    "- __Score weights__:the weights to compute the overall score of an object (e.g. car or person). When computing the overall score the highest weights will be assigned to the most confident joints.\n",
    "- __Categories__ of the keypoints. In this case, the only category is car.\n",
    "- __Standard pose__ of the keypoints, to visualize the connections between the keypoints and as an argument for the head network.\n",
    "- __Horizontal flip__ equivalents, if you use horizontal flipping as augmentation technique, you will need to define the corresponding left and right and keypoints as a dictionary. E.g. left_ear --> right_ear.  In our plugin this is called HFLIP\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the constants, the module contains two functions to draw the skeleton and save it as an image. The functions are only for debugging and can usually be used as they are, only changing the arguments with the new constants.
