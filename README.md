> Many image-based perception tasks can be formulated as detecting, associating
> and tracking semantic keypoints, e.g., human body pose estimation and tracking.
> In this work, we present a general framework that jointly detects and forms
> spatio-temporal keypoint associations in a single stage, making this the first
> real-time pose detection and tracking algorithm. We present a generic neural
> network architecture that uses Composite Fields to detect and construct a
> spatio-temporal pose which is a single, connected graph whose nodes are the
> semantic keypoints (e.g., a person's body joints) in multiple frames. For the
> temporal associations, we introduce the Temporal Composite Association Field
> (TCAF) which requires an extended network architecture and training method
> beyond previous Composite Fields. Our experiments show competitive accuracy
> while being an order of magnitude faster on multiple publicly available datasets
> such as COCO, CrowdPose and the PoseTrack 2017 and 2018 datasets. We also show
> that our method generalizes to any class of semantic keypoints such as car and
> animal parts to provide a holistic perception framework that is well suited for
> urban mobility such as self-driving cars and delivery robots.
